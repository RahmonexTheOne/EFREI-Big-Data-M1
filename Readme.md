# EFREI M1 - Big Data Labs

This repository contains the corrections and implementations of the labs given in the **Big Data** Unit as part of the M1 level at **EFREI Engineering School**. The labs involve various classification tasks, data preprocessing, and machine learning model training on different datasets.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three labs:

### 1. **Lab 1: Iris Dataset Classification**
In this lab, we work with the well-known **Iris dataset**. The task involves:
- Data exploration and visualization.
- Building classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Decision Trees**.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. **Lab 2: IoT Device Classification**
This lab focuses on **IoT classification**, where we work with data from IoT devices to classify device types or behaviors:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Building models using **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **KNN**.
- Comparing model performance and optimizing for better results.

### 3. **Lab 3: Classification with Logistic Regression, KNN, and MLP on NSL-KDD Dataset**
In this lab, we perform **intrusion detection** on the **NSL-KDD dataset**, which is commonly used for network security research. The key tasks include:
- Preprocessing data with categorical and numerical features.
- Building classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**.
- Model evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Detailed comparison of model performance using confusion matrices.
